R Style Guide

We try to stick to styles defined by Google:
https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html

and tidyverse:
https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html

In particular, we use: 
* FunctionNames (words start with capital letters)
* object_names (lower letters, words separated by "_")
* Spaces after commas and not before, after if/for/..., around "="" for assignments
* If function calls get too long, we use single lines for each argument
* Function calls as package::function

Exceptions to styles from Google and tidyverse:
* No spaces around "="" in function calls
* "=" for assignments, not "<-"
* Skip function call as package::function for ggplot2 and operators; plus Seurat "subset", where it does not work
